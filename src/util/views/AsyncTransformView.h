// An input range that yields `transformation(element)` for each `element` of
// the `Range`, in the original order of the elements, like
// `ql::views::transform`. The difference is that up to `maxNumElementsInFlight`
// elements are read ahead and transformed on an `executor`, concurrently with
// the consumer of this range, which is still processing the previously yielded
// elements. This pays off if the `transformation` is expensive and independent
// for each element. In contrast to `streams::runStreamAsync`, which runs the
// whole range sequentially on a single background thread, the
// `transformation` of different elements runs in parallel.
//
// The elements that are read ahead are not handed to the `executor` one by
// one. Instead, tasks on the `executor` ("runners") transform them one after
// the other, in their order. This keeps the elements of one range (for example
// the blocks of one index scan) on few threads, each of which works through
// consecutive elements, so that their data stays in the caches of that
// thread's core. Spreading them over all the threads of a busy shared pool,
// interleaved with the elements of other ranges, lowers the throughput of all
// of them considerably. When the consumer needs an element that no runner has
// started yet, it transforms that element itself instead of waiting for it, so
// the consumer never waits for a task that is still queued behind the tasks of
// other users of the `executor`.
//
// The number of runners adapts to the load of the `executor`: at most one
// runner of this range is queued on the `executor` at a time, and the next one
// is only posted once it has started. On an idle `executor`, the runners start
// right away, so this range quickly uses as many threads as it has elements
// in flight (but at most `maxNumRunners`). On a busy `executor`, the queued
// runner waits behind the tasks of other users, so this range stays on few
// threads. A runner ends after it has run for `maxRunnerDuration` and requeues
// the remaining elements at the end of the `executor`'s queue (unless another
// runner of this range is already queued), so that a range with many elements
// can't keep a thread to itself while other users of the `executor` wait.
//
// The elements of the `Range` are moved into the tasks that transform them,
// and each result is moved out of its task when it is yielded, so both the
// elements and the results may be move-only types. The `transformation` is
// invoked as a `const` callable from several threads at the same time, so it
// has to be thread-safe in that sense.
//
// NOTE 1: Up to `maxNumElementsInFlight` elements (or their results) are held
// in memory at the same time, in addition to the result that the consumer
// holds.
//
// NOTE 2: An exception that is thrown by the `transformation` is rethrown when
// the consumer reaches the result of the respective element. An exception
// that is thrown by the `Range` itself is thrown directly to the consumer.
//
// NOTE 3: When this range is destroyed, the elements that are still pending
// and that no runner has started yet are dropped without being transformed.
// The destructor waits for the transformations that are already running.
//
// IMPORTANT: The consumer blocks while it waits for an element that a runner
// is currently transforming, so this range must not be consumed from a thread
// of the `executor`. The execution context behind the `executor` has to
// outlive this range.
//
// NOTE 4: This range is neither copyable nor movable. Wrap it into an
// `InputRangeTypeErased` (via `std::make_unique`) if it has to be passed
// around.
//
// NOTE 5: The results are stored and yielded by value (`std::decay_t` of the
// return type of the `transformation`). In particular, a `transformation` that
// returns a reference to its argument (like `std::identity`) is fine, because
// the result is moved out of the element before the element is destroyed.
